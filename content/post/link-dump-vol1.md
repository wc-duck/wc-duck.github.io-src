During my time of work this christmas I had lots of plans to work on some of my hobby-projects or maybe just check out some new stuff... none of that happened :D But I can at least write something, something low effort that is!

I have had this document (and an ever growing youtube "watch later"-list!) where I have just dumped links to blog-posts, presentations and videos that I have found in one way or another interesting. 

> Interesting here might not mean that I agree with everything etc, but it gave me "something" when consumed. 

So what is better than saved links in private? Sharing them maybe!

This will be full of links that I haven't touched for a long time, I might not even remember why I saved them more than that I found it worth saving. I started of by writing a little something about each link but it just turned out not adding anything really. If you want to know why it ended up in here, ping me!

Many of these has also "done the rounds" but maybe you will find something that you haven't already seen?
