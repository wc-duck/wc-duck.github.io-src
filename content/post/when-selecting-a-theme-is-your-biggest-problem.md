title: "When selecting a theme is your biggest problem!"

I have been using [pellican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to generate and maintain my blog sinces its inception and it has been mainly fine. However after getting a new machine and starting to fiddle with a new post I started noticing things such as installation being far from optimal and it no longer generating a functioning site after updating pellican.

After an update all line-breaks in code-segments just got removed, did I configure something wrong, what to do to fix it? Don't know and Im not really keen on finding out.

This looked like a perfect time to try out something new and since [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) seems to be the "hottest thing around" I went for that...

And such a treat it was! As the title states, the hardest thing of this migration was to actually select a theme I liked (ended up with [harbor](https://github.com/matsuyoshi30/harbor) by [Masaya Watanabe](https://github.com/matsuyoshi30/) as you might see :))! Everything else was just a smooth. Things such as:

* From having a single binary to "install"
* Really simple setup
* Great [get started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)-doc
* Smooth builtin server with auto-update on content updates.
* Being markdown-based, making it trivial to switch from pellican.

Simply a treat to work with!

Don't think I have anything else to add and I hope to be able to roll out some more "meaty" posts in the future. I have one in the making that has been sitting, waiting to be completed, since christmas that I hope to publish soon.
