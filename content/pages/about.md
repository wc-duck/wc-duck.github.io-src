### Who I am

I'm [Fredrik Kihlander](http://kihlander.net), engine programmer at [Avalanche Studios](http://avalanchestudios.com) by day, father and avid amateur cook at night.

The goal of this blog is to have somewhere to write down code-related things that might be of interest to others. Mainly C++ ( with a really light 
emphasis on the ++:es ), maybe some python and general game-dev stuff.

Don't expect regular updates!
