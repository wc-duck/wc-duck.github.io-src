# Who I am

I'm Fredrik Kihlander, engine programmer at Avalanche Studios by day, father and avid amateur cook at night.

The goal of this blog is to have somewhere to write down code-related things that might be of interest to others. Mainly C++ ( with a really light emphasis on the ++:es ), maybe some python and general game-dev stuff.

Don't expect regular updates!
